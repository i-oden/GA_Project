Uppmax is under maintenance. No jobs can be started.

Uppmax is under maintenance. Crex is down --> Project directories and module system not working.
--> cannot access the files. 

Plan of first things to do when UPPMAX is upp and running again:
1. Find the files:
	cd /proj/g2018003/nobackup/private/ etc 
2. Make appropriate directories 
	a) cd data
	b) mkdir raw_data
	c) mkdir trimmed_data
	d) cd raw_data
	e) mkdir DNA
	f) cd DNA
	g) mkdir PacBio
	h) cd ..
	i) etc
3. Rename the files as they are called in the metadata.csv file and create a link to the git directory
	ln -s /proj/g2018003/nobackup/private/and_so_on_to_the_original_file /GA_Project/directory_to_new_renamed_file
4. Create batch script for assembly
	Created - has to be finished: 
		1_genome_assembly.sh
5. Connect to a working node 
	salloc -A g2018003 -p core -n 1 -t 08:00:00(?) --reservation=g2018003_2
6. Send job to uppmax
	sbatch 1_genome_assembly.sh

Fixing of canu script.

19.04.2018 
Missing text in log file from this date. 

1. Assembly batch script finished
2. Sent the assembly batch script
3. Got an email about timed out assembly - but may still have finished?

Missing text in log file from 19.04.2018 noticed. 

1. Checking slurm-file slurm-2751120.out to see whether I need to send it again... 
2. Fixed the directory error in the batch script. 
3. Moved the files to the correct directory. 
	GA_Project/data/assembled_data/DNA/PacBio/
4. Deleted all output files.
5. Resent the assembly batch script
	Finished!

The next step is to evaluate the assembly! 
--> QUAST and manual! 
6. QUAST on... 
	file: efaecium.contigs.fasta
	Commands: 
		python quast.py [options] <contig_file(s)>
		
		-o (output directory) = /home/inod5951/GA_Project/data/assembled_data/DNA/PacBio/QUAST_eval
		--min-contig or -m (minimum contig length used) = 
		--labels or -l (human-readable assembly names) = "Canu1.7_PB_DNA_Assembly"

	Output: 
		report.txt	assessment summary in plain text format
		report.tsv	tab-separated version of the summary, suitable for spreadsheets
		report.tex	LaTeX version of the summary
		icarus.html	Icarus main manu with links to interactive viewers
		report.pdf	all other plots combined with all tables 
		report.html	HTML version of the report with interactive plots inside
		contigs_reports/
			misassemblies_report	Detailed report on misassemblies
			unaligned_report	Detailed report on unaligned and partially unaligned contigs

CHECK NEXT TIME:
Seems strange that the evaluation was so fast, and that the results say that the total length of the genome is 3 142 355 bp, when it's actually 2.7 m something bp. - Maybe will be corrected with illumina in extra steps.
